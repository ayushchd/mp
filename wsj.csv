"Starvation in India is a brutal but little-discussed reality. We are publishing a six-part series on this issue this week: http://on.wsj.com/starving_in_india2.

Tulsi Manjhi, pictured here with his daughter, recalls laying silently next to his wife, Gita Devi, on a khattiya, a cot made of bamboo and coconut fiber after she gave birth to her sixth child.

Villagers recall her losing weight rapidly and say they couldn’t help because they didn’t have sufficient food either.

“I was hungry too but she couldn’t even get up,” Mr. Manjhi recalls. “I tried to feed her jinghi (leaves from trees) once.” 

She died eight days after giving birth. An activist who advises India’s Supreme Court on food security issues deemed Gita Devi’s a starvation death.
