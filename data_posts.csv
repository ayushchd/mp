"In a very special episode of Uttaran: The year is 2036. The world is a post apocalyptic wasteland. The machines have taken over and humanity is an empty shell of remorse. As most humans perish, some have developed abilities far beyond biological scope.

Ichcha looks at her mechanical arm, and for a second, she is transported back to simpler times when all she wanted to do was eat a mithai without spilling it on jijaji, simpler times when dowry interest rates were cheaper and the world was entirely populated by people in Ritu Kumar sherwanis. 

Feeling the sonic boom of a nearby drone, she is jolted back to reality and in succession uses her mechanical arm to A. apply sindoor (psych, it's actually the blood of a local sarpanch) and B. use its grappling hook feature to scale the tallest building in post-apocalyptic Gwalior (two floors). As she looks at the desolate landscape before her, her eyes well up as she fondly remembers that one time she went to the tailor's with Tapasya and found a button that read 'I'.

"An important public service announcement from Tzinga:

Tomorrow is International Internet Cat Appreciation Day. It is an actual day that was not made up by us. It totally exists. And if it doesn't, it should. 
Much has been said about the utter lack of cats on the Internet. It's almost as if the internet doesn't want felinekind to be represented in all its pawsome glory. Absolutely no people post pictures of their cat on the internet. As if they're ashamed to own one. According to our data, exactly three people have posted pictures of cats since 1999. And two of them are those awful ASCII drawings with roses around them. If this doesn't break your heart, this incident surely will. A Youtube user named 'pu$$yl0v3rrr69' (Real name withheld to protect identity. Also we really don't know. But his birth year seems to be the year 1969) was recently banned for uploading a video of what could've only been an innocent pussycat licking its paws.

Due to this media blackout, millions of people around the world have actually forgotten what a cat looks like. 
""Does it look like a week old banana?"", a popular Bollywood actor was quoted saying.

No they don't, popular Bollywood actor. No they don't. Over the years many cats have stood up to this injustice and gross undervaluation. But since cats can stand up for like three seconds before falling and gravely injuring themselves, all of their efforts so far have been in vain. So let's take a moment off our busy, productive lives and salute our brave cats overseas. 

Let us salute Cheezburger Cat who valiantly fought against discrimination to muster up the courage to ask for a Cheeseburger in broad daylight. Or grumpy cat for being the calm face of reason through these trying times. Or Yanni, for playing the keyboards well into the 90s when we all know that keyboards were outlawed by The Honourable World President Kumar Gaurav in 1978.
Let's step out of the dark ages and embrace cats like they belonged all along!

At night, you are truly yourself. All your desires, cravings and ideas, come to the fore.
